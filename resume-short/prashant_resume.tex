		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Verified Parsing Toolkit for Binary Formats:} Built a verified attribute-based parsing expression grammar parser in Dafny, embedded correctness and termination proofs to show that the algorithm is correct
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Generated at least 4 major changes to PDF specification using a PDF parser written in Rust
          \item Detected several commonly-seen packet malformations using a RTPS parser written in Dafny and Go
        \end{itemize}
          %We demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool on various protocols such as OpenDDS (RTPS) and MQTT. \textit{\color{dartmouthgreen} Dafny, Go}.
				%\item \textbf{Building LangSec Compliant protocol clients:} We have so far built implementations of the MQTT, XMPP, DNP3 and C37.118 protocols. All of which are used in the Industrial IoT and Smart Grid. Our implementations are presently being used actively in the power grid by several vendors. \textit{\color{dartmouthgreen} Dafny, VHDL, Python, Ruby}.
        \item \textbf{Parsing Data Formats in Hardware:} Designed and implemented two data-format parsers for FPGAs: (i) based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs), and (ii) building on symbolic register automata
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Highly parallel VHDL parsers automatically generated from Dafny run in less than 5 clock cycles for large inputs
        \end{itemize}
        %Both approaches complete the parsing operations in using \textbf{highly parallel} techniques. \textit{\color{dartmouthgreen} Dafny, VHDL}.

        \item \textbf{Securing Power Grid Networks using Parsers:} Built a tool to detect attacks on the power grid network and provide steps to regain control
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Detected all attempted attacks and malicious operations 
          \item Recommended steps to successfully restore power supply using automated tools

        \end{itemize}
        %\item \textbf{An MTurk Study Examining How Users Evaluate URLs:} Designed and executed a large-scale quantitative study to determine what are some unsafe URL structures to which users are more susceptible
        %A large-scale (1100 participants) quantitative study to determine what are some unsafe URL structures to which users are most susceptible. \textit{\color{dartmouthgreen} Python, MTurk}.
        %\begin{itemize}
          %\item Verified various hypotheses using the Pearson's chi-squared test on the data
          %\item Analysis revealed that the use of monospace for links reduces the chances of users clicking malicious links
        %\end{itemize}
				%\item \textbf{Expert Elicitation Study:} I conducted an Expert Elicitation Study to understand desired features in Data Description Languages via a qualitative study using the Delphi Method (20 interviews with experts).
                %\item \textbf{Kabali:} Developed a tool to visualize ruby YARV structures, and to  traverse through them step by step by tracing the state of the stack at each move at Dartmouth College. \textit{(Ruby).}
				%\item \textbf{The Guindy Times Website:} Developed the website, Android application and the entire API for my undergraduate college campus newspaper. \textit{(Ruby on Rails, Android, Java, CSS, Javascript, HTML)}
